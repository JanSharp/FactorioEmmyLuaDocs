# Libs

From the internet, smile:
- [LuaFileSystem](https://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/)
- [The json lib](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua)
- [crc32](https://gist.github.com/SafeteeWoW/080e784e5ebfda42cad486c58e6d26e4)
- [serpent](https://github.com/pkulchenko/serpent)

The following are from the [LuaPreprocessor](https://github.com/JanSharp/FactorioLuaPreprocessor) project and should be moved to a library project:
- args_service.lua (modified to fit this project's args)
- args_util.lua
- path.lua
- classes.lua (this has been updated in this repository)
